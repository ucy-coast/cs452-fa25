# Homework Assignment 2

Submission Deadline: October 10, 2025

This is an individual assignment to be conducted individually by each student.

## Inverted Index

Inverted indices are widely used in computer science, and are particularly useful in document searching. Broadly speaking, an inverted index is a map from interesting facts about the underlying data, to the original location of that data. For example, in the context of search, it might be a map from keywords to documents that contain those words. 

For this exercise, you will have you build Map and Reduce functions for generating an inverted index.

We have created a second binary in `cmd/invertedindex/main.go` that is very similar to the `cmd/wordcount/main.go` you built earlier. You should modify `mapF` and `reduceF` in `cmd/invertedindex/main.go` so that they together produce an inverted index. 

#### Map Function

The `mapF` function processes each document and generates a list of (word, filename) pairs. For every word in the document, emit a pair with the word as the key and the document name as the value. Normalize words (e.g., convert to uppercase or lowercase) to ensure consistency.

```
Input: (filename, contents)

Output: [(word1, filename), (word2, filename), …]
```

#### Reduce Function

The `reduceF` function receives a word and a list of all document names in which that word appeared. Its job is to produce a single string containing the number of documents followed by the filenames in sorted, comma-separated order.

```
Input: (word, list of filenames)

Output: (word, "#documents file1,file2,…")
```

#### Note on duplicates

You need to ensure that each document is counted only once per word in the final output. How you handle duplicates is flexible: you can remove duplicates either in the map function (emitting each word once per document) or in the reduce function (filtering the list of filenames). Both approaches are valid as long as the final index reflects unique documents for each word.

#### Testing

Running `cmd/invertedindex/main.go` should output a list of tuples, one per line, in the following format. 

```
$ go run `cmd/invertedindex/main.go master sequential test/data/pg-*.txt`
$ head -n5 mrtmp.iiseq
A: 16 pg-being_ernest.txt,pg-dorian_gray.txt,pg-dracula.txt,pg-emma.txt,pg-frankenstein.txt,pg-great_expectations.txt,pg-grimm.txt,pg-huckleberry_finn.txt,pg-les_miserables.txt,pg-metamorphosis.txt,pg-moby_dick.txt,pg-sherlock_holmes.txt,pg-tale_of_two_cities.txt,pg-tom_sawyer.txt,pg-ulysses.txt,pg-war_and_peace.txt
ABC: 2 pg-les_miserables.txt,pg-war_and_peace.txt
ABOUT: 2 pg-moby_dick.txt,pg-tom_sawyer.txt
ABRAHAM: 1 pg-dracula.txt
ABSOLUTE: 1 pg-les_miserables.txt
```

If it is not clear from the listing above, the format is:

```
word: #documents documents,sorted,and,separated,by,commas
```

You can test your implementation's correctness with the following command, which should produce these resulting last 10 items in the index:

```
sort -k1,1 mrtmp.iiseq | sort -snk2,2 mrtmp.iiseq | grep -v '16' | tail -10

(this sample result is also found in test/scripts/test-ii.out)

To make testing easy for you, from the project directory, run:

```
$ sh ./test/scripts/test-ii.sh
```

and it will report if your solution is correct or not.

### Submission

Now you need to submit your assignment. Commit your change and push it to the remote repository by doing the following:

```
$ git commit -am "[you fill me in]"
$ git push -u origin main
```

You may push you code as many times you like, grading and submission time will be based on your last push.
